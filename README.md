You can add, edit, delete your customers(full name, phone number, gmail, priority{1-3}) for now. I will add backend and property part later. Also I use FontAwesome for this project maybe can be necessary to launch properly, I use 13inch Mac so dont know if it will work on other resolution. Buttons will work visually!!
